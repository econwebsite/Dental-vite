     <p>e-con Systems offers a diverse range of GigE series cameras, providing high-resolution imaging even in low light conditions and supporting longer cable lengths. Using standard interfaces such as Power over Ethernet (PoE) with IEEE 802.3af compliance allows GigE cameras to transmit power as well as data over a single GigE interface. This GigE camera's built-in ISP offers imaging controls - ensuring exceptional image quality. With the direct connect interface - they can connect multiple cameras over a network, supporting synchronization through Precision Time Protocol (PTP). This series ensures high-quality and easy data sharing with its H.264/H.265 video encoding capability. Additionally, the camera supports the ONVIF application.</p>
